  <h3>Project: Private Events</h3>
  <p>You want to build a site similar to a private <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/">Eventbrite</a> which allows users to create events and then manage user signups.</p>
  <br><p>A user can create events. A user can attend many events. An event can be attended by many users. Events take place at a specific date and at a location (which you can just store as a string, like “Andy’s House”).</p>
  <br><p>This project will require you to model many-to-many relationships and also to be very conscious about your foreign keys and class names (hint: you won’t be able to just rely on Rails’ defaults like you have before).</p>
